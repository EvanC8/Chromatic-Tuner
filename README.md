# Natural♮ | Mobile Chromatic Tuner
Inspired by the guitar tuning apps I use daily, this project was created to experiment with audio signal processing through the lens of musical pitch tuning. What began as a simple idea—detecting pitch from a phone’s microphone input—quickly turned into a deep dive into the quite exciting complexities of frequency analysis. The result is a versatile and simplistic chromatic tuner, designed to recognize pitches across a wide range of instruments tuned on the Western enharmonic system. I've included the app's views and helper classes (written in Swift for iOS) in this repo. An overview of the app's core processes can also be found below. Hope you enjoy!

# How it works

### Microphone Input Filtering
### Fast Fourier Transform
### Frequency Estimation
### Musical Interpretation

# Next Steps
* Improve signal processing methods to denoise mic input and measure frequency more accurately
